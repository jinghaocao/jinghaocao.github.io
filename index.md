I am a [<font color="#FF6C0C">von Karman Instructor</font>](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/about/positions/vonkarman) in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at [<font color="#FF6C0C">Caltech</font>](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/jinghao-cao). I am mentored by Professor [<font color="#FF6C0C">Oscar Bruno</font>](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/people/obruno). 
My research is on <font color="#FF6C0C">numerical methods and analysis of PDEs</font>.
	
Before Caltech, I obtained my doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics from [<font color="#215CAF">ETH Zurich</font>](https://math.ethz.ch/news-and-events/news/d-math-news/2024/05/doctoral-exam-of-jinghao-cao.html) (Switzerland) in 2024, supervised by Professor [<font color="#215CAF">Habib Ammari</font>](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~hammari/). My second advisor is Professor Alessio Figalli. 

Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor (2017-2021) and Master's degree (2020-2021) in Mathematics with distinction from ETH Zurich with a year abroad (2019-2020) at Imperial College London (UK).

I am fluent in Chinese, English and German. My Chinese name is 曹景皓.
